It is a project that I made a OpenCV library, which has features such as taking photos, recording videos, applying effects to the image, detecting colors, drawing shapes or lines on the screen. And also, I am designing a GUI to use these features with the tkinter library. With this GUI, I want to develop an application that recording videos, taking pictures, applying color space filters, thresholding, detect shapes in user-uploaded images. </br>

I continue to develop the application. Thanks...
